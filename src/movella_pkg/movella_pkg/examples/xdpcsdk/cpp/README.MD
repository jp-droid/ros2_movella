Below we describe the steps to run the 64 bit Example on Windows 10 64 bit

 1. Open the cpp.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio
 2. Make sure the dependencies for your platform are there
    1. By default these are expected to be in `$(ProjectDir)..\..\$(Platform)\` but this can of course be adjusted
        in the project settings. For Windows 64 for example $(ProjectDir)..\..\x64\
 3. Select the Configurations, for example Release and x64.
